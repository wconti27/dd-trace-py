    tracing: Adds support for the builtin multiprocessing library by enabling module unloading by default.
    With this change the ddtrace library will save copies of dependency modules for internal use by ``ddtrace`` that 
    will be unaffected by future imports of and changes to those modules by application code.
    This feature can be disabled by setting ``DD_UNLOAD_MODULES_FROM_SITECUSTOMIZE`` configuration to False.
